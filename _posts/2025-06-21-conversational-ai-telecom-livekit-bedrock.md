Conversational AI is rapidly transforming the telecom industry by enabling more human-like, intelligent, and efficient customer interactions. In this work, our team built a real-time voice agent that leverages LiveKit for low-latency audio streaming, Amazon Bedrock Nova Sonic for delivering multimodal intelligence with minimal response delay.

The solution supports streaming voice input, contextual understanding, memory retention, and intelligent response generationâ€”making it a robust framework for telecom use cases like customer support automation, IVR upgrades, and agent assistance. Weâ€™ve outlined the full architecture and key implementation details in the following post:
