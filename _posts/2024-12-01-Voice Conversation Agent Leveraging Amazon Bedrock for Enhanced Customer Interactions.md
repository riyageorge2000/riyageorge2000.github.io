The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized various industries, including customer service. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Here we explore the integration of Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service that makes LLMs accessible to developers, with Amazon Connect, a cloud-based contact center solution, to enhance customer interactions. By combining the capabilities of Amazon Bedrock, Lex and Connect, we have developed a solution that can transcribe customer interactions in real-time, understand customer intent and sentiment, provide relevant information and assistance, automate routine tasks, and personalize interactions based on customer history and preferences. This integration leverages the power of LLMs to improve customer satisfaction and efficiency for our telecommunication industry application.

The key components of our solution, including Amazon Connect, Amazon Lex, and Amazon Bedrock and delve into the use of Lambda functions, Cloudwatch and Amazon Connect flows.
