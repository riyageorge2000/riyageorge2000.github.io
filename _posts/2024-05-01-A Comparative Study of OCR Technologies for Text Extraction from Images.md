Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a powerful technology that enables the conversion of printed, typed, or handwritten text within images into machine-readable text. This is essential for automating data extraction from scanned documents, forms, blueprints, and other visual formats.

This article compares four popular OCR technologies:

- **Tesseract OCR**
- **PaddleOCR**
- **Google Cloud Vision OCR**
- **Amazon Textract**

These tools were tested for their effectiveness in extracting text from images with varied layouts—particularly floor plans.

## 🧪 Evaluation Criteria

The tools were evaluated based on:

- **Accuracy**
- **Layout Preservation**
- **Robustness to Noise**
- **Support for Handwriting & Rotation**
- **Processing Speed**
- **Cost Efficiency**

---

## 📌 Tesseract OCR

Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine developed by HP and maintained by Google.

**✅ Pros:**
- Free and open-source
- Supports multiple languages

**❌ Cons:**
- Poor handling of rotated or low-quality text
- Fails to preserve layout
- Character misrecognition (e.g., “ft” → “fr”)

**💡 Best for:** Simple, clean printed documents where layout is unimportant.

---

## 📌 PaddleOCR

PaddleOCR is a deep learning-based OCR system developed by Baidu.

**✅ Pros:**
- Open-source
- Some layout awareness
- Better on handwritten text than Tesseract

**❌ Cons:**
- Inconsistent layout detection
- Character misrecognition (e.g., “S” → “5”)
- Sequential reading order not guaranteed

**💡 Best for:** Layout-aware OCR where deep learning advantages are needed.

---

## 📌 Google Cloud Vision OCR

Google's OCR service offers high accuracy and can handle complex, rotated, or handwritten content.

**✅ Pros:**
- Very accurate
- Minimal preprocessing
- Supports rotation, handwriting, multiple languages

**❌ Cons:**
- Paid service (after 1000 units/month)
- Layout reconstruction is limited
- Requires internet access

**💡 Best for:** High-accuracy text extraction from noisy or rotated documents.

---

## 📌 Amazon Textract

Textract is Amazon’s machine learning OCR tool that extracts structured data including tables and forms.

**✅ Pros:**
- High text and layout accuracy
- Great for complex documents
- Preprocessing often unnecessary

**❌ Cons:**
- Costly for large-scale usage
- Layout extraction has separate pricing

**💡 Best for:** Extracting structured text where layout and order matter (e.g., forms, blueprints).

## ✅ Final Takeaways

- Use **Tesseract** for budget-friendly basic OCR tasks.
- Use **PaddleOCR** for layout-aware open-source solutions.
- Choose **Google Cloud Vision** for high-accuracy needs when layout is less important.
- Select **Amazon Textract** for structured document extraction where layout matters.

**Conclusion:**  
The choice of OCR tool depends heavily on your use case—whether it’s raw text extraction, layout reconstruction, or scalability across large document batches. For industry-grade accuracy and layout fidelity, cloud-based solutions like Google Cloud Vision and Amazon Textract offer clear advantages despite their cost.
