Amazon has introduced the Nova family of foundation models on Amazon Bedrock, tailored for various use cases across cost, speed, and multimodal capabilities. Here's a breakdown of the core Nova models:

- **Nova Micro**: Text-only model offering lowest latency and cost.
- **Nova Lite**: Ultra-fast multimodal model handling text, image, and video inputs at low cost.
- **Nova Pro**: Balanced, high-performing multimodal model optimized for speed, cost, and accuracy.
- **Nova Canvas**: Advanced model for image generation.
- **Nova Reel**: Specialized model for video generation.

## üîç Key Observations

- **Nova Micro** is the **fastest** among all tested models, followed closely by **Nova Lite**.
- **Nova Pro** offers the **best quality-to-speed balance**, making it ideal for production-grade multimodal tasks.
- Among Anthropic models showed the most improved quality, but still lags behind Nova models in speed.
- Among the Anthropic models, Sonnet 3 and Sonnet 3.5 takes largest time.
- **Nova Pro** and **Haiku 3.5** provide better response quality compared to Nova Micro and Lite, useful for tasks needing deeper reasoning.
